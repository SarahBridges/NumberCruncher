<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>11<br />4<br />41<br />50<br />7<br />19<br />8<br />18<br />2<br />6<br />43<br />6<br />
20<br />43<br />2<br />23<br />12<br />24<br />31<br />29</p>
<h3>Mean</h3>
<p>The mean of a set of numbers is the average. So we take the sum of all the numbers in the set 
and divide it by the number of numbers in the set. <br /> The sum is 400 and there are 20 numbers
in the set.<br />The mean is 20.</p>
<h3>Mode</h3>
<p><b>2, 2,</b> 4, <b>6, 6,</b> 7, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 29, 31, 41, <b>43, 43,</b> 50</p>
<p>The mode of a set of numbers is the the number (or numbers) that appear most often in the set.
<br />There are three modes in this set of numbers and they each appear twice in the set.<br />
The modes are 2, 6, and 43.</p>
<h3>Median</h3>
<p>2, 2, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, <b>18, 19,</b> 20, 23, 24, 29, 31, 41, 43, 43, 50</p>
<p>The median of a set of numbers is the value (or two values) which appear in the middle of the set,
when the numbers are written in numerical order. <br />Because there are an even number of numbers in 
this set, there are two numbers that split the middle, so there are two medians.<br /> The medians are 
18 and 19.</p>
